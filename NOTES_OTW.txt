cat >> file
you write here
exit with Ctrl+C

	BANDIT 01
if a filename is -
you cannot use cat bcs it confuses - with something else
if you want to see the file:
1) use absolute path ( or cat ./- )
2) cat < -

	BANDIT 02
if a filename is called --spaces in this filename--
cat with ' and " didnt work and neither \ and tab
instead use:
cat -- "--spaces in this filename--"
bcs before cat "--spaces in this filename"
above cat interpretes --spaces as parameter
(even tho there are ")
so in order that cat qouldnt confuse it use:
-- before it so cat now that what follows it is
actually a name and not a parameter

to clean terminal we can also use reset

how to find out what kind f file it is- if it is humanly readable
do: file ./-file*
and like that you see if file is ascii or data

	BANDIT 05
here the file had to be humanly readable, not executable and of size 1033b
i used:
ls -lh ./maybeher*/* ./maybeher*/.*
-> with this i could see thich files were executable and which not
file ./maybehere*/* ./maybehere*/.*
-> that way i find it if a file contains ascii or data or other type
-> with this i can also see hidden files
find ./maybehere*/ -type f -size 1033c
-> this command gave me only one file which was also the correct one

	BANDIT 06
file can be anywhere in the server
owned by bandit7 and group bandit6 size 33c
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c

	BANDIT 08
paswd is uniq - only once in file
sort data.txt | uniq -u

the reason why uniq -u data.txt doesnt work is bcs uniq only
removes adjacent duplicates - so first we gotta make them adjacent
with sort
in short uniq -u should be used together with sort

	BANDIT 09
to search for a string in a binary data file:
strings data.txt

	BANDIT 10
if a file is in base64 then we can decrypt it
base64 -d data.txt

	BANDIT 11
file is encrypted with ROT13 - we use tr to decrypt:
tr "a-zA-Z" "N-ZA-Mn-za-m" < data.txt

	BANDIT 12
we got a hexdump - to reverse it we used xxd -r filename
then with command file we checked the file type
$ file data.txt
here it wrote if it is compressed gzip, bzip or tar file
even tho i tried to bunzip, gunzip and tar-x nothing worked
apparently it was important what kind of koncovku maju
so if it showed it was a gzip file - i had to rename the file into
data -> data.gz 
and the same fro bzip2 -> data.bz and tar -> data.tar
only when i had the endings i could decompress and unarchive the file

|| new what i learned:
from hexdump we can see the magic bytes which determine the file type

lmao i died here
i just had to go to bandit13 and see where the private ssh key is located
once i new, i logged out, anda stayed in my own mashine and put this cmd:
scp -P 2220 bandit13@bandit.lab.overthewire.org:/home/bandit13/sshkey.private .

then it asked me pswd for bandit13, and it usccessf downloaded the file
now just gotta change private key perms
for the key the work it HAS to have 600 perms, if not, change into that
then:
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
and done!
